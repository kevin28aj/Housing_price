# Housing Price

The main goal of the project is to analyse the housing price in a market.

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market.
The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.
You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
